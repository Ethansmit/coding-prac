Name: Score of a String
Type: Algorithm
Difficulty: Easy
From: LeetCode

Description:
    You are given a string "s." The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

    Return the score of "s."

Assumptions:
    - s.lenght >= 2
    - s only contains English lower case letters.

Example:
    Input: s = "hello"
    Output: 13

    Input: s = "zaz"
    Output: 50


Solution Explanation:
    For loop, O(N):
        This problem simply involves looping through the string and performing the absolute value calculation of the distance in ASCII.

        Algorithm Pseudocode:
            1. Set score = 0.
            2. Loop through the string and for each pair of values, calculate their ASCII distance.

        Proof of Correctness:
            Using the absolute value operator ensures that distances are calculated.

        Proof of Runtime:
            The algorithm loops through every character in the string and does a constant time operation, hence the runtime is O(N).
