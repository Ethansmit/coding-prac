Name: Print Three Statements in Order
Type: Concurrency
Difficulty: Easy
From: LeetCode

Description:
    We are given a class which contains three different threads. Thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and 
    thread C calls third(). Design an algorithm which ensures that second() is executed after first() and third() is
    executed after second(). Note that the threads can be scheduled in various ways, but the execution must be done
    in the same order no matter the input.

Assumptions:
    - input is permutation of [1, 2, 3]

Example:
    Input: [1,2,3]
    Output: "firstsecondthird"

    Input: [1,3,2]
    Output: "firstsecondthird"


Solution Explanation:
    Various Concurrency Solutions O(1):
        The focus is to utilize some concurrency method which forces the second thread to wait on the completion of the first
        thread and forces the third thread to wait on the completion of the second thread.
